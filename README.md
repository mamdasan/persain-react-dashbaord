### jest

Jest acts as a test runner, assertion library, and mocking library. Jest also provides Snapshot testing, the ability to
create a rendered ‘snapshot’ of a component and compare it to a previously saved ‘snapshot’. The test will fail if the
two do not match

### Enzyme

Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React
Components’ output.

Enzyme, created by Airbnb, adds some great additional utility methods for rendering a component (or multiple components)
, finding elements, and interacting with elements
